# Portfolio

A portfolio web-site where i showcase my work

[The Website](https://exoldarium.github.io/Portfolio/)

## General info

Originally i made my portofolio using CRA but i decided to switch to webpack as a way to learn how to start my own React app. CRA is great but i didn't need all of the dependencies that it comes with for this website. It was a challenge setting everything up to work how i wanted but it was a great learning experience.
