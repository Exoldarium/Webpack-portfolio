# Portfolio

A portfolio web-site where i showcase my work

[The Website](https://exoldarium.github.io/Webpack-portfolio/)

## General info

Originally i made my portofolio using CRA but i decided to switch to webpack as a way to learn how to serve my app without using any frameworks. The code was taken from my previous portfolio app that was already finished so i've mostly been configuring webpack in this repo and setting everything up to work how i wanted. CRA is great but i realized that i didn't need all of the dependencies that it comes with for this website. It was a challenge setting everything at first but also a great learning experience. 

## Installation
Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Run the app localy
